			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				Uptown Management Tools is website designed to streamline many of the common tasks that managers 
				must do. It is meant to both expedite and simplify tasks such as managing current staff, along with 
				their skillsets and availabilities, creating daily work schedules, and accessing contact information for 
				customers. Along with this, UMT has features for creating and tracking tasks, as well
				as displaying some statistical insights about the company.

			</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				The audience is employees that are in some form of managerial role for their company. Anyone that helps to plan out the details
				of the week, and helps to ensure that everything is in place for business to run would have access to the program.
			</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				Features such as the to-do list, daily schedules, staff profiles, and customer contact information will all 
				be dynamically generated. This information will either be stored in JavaScript arrays, or maybe a lightweight DB, 
				depending on how much information there is, and then the data will be rendered as needed.

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
			<h4>Heading Font: Poppins</h4>
			<p> 
				I chose the Poppins font because it is clean and clear. 
				None of the letters have any potentially confusing characteristics. 
				I also thought it was similar to Fira Sans, so they fit well together.
			</p>
			<h4>Paragraph Font: Fira Sans</h4>
			<p>
				I chose Fira Sans becausae I thought it had a nice modern look to it.
				It also seems to meet all of the accesibility rules. Overall, it felt like
				a very legible, orderly, and pleasing font.
			</p>

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

			<h3>Dashboard Page</h3>
			<p>
				The nav menu on the left will be collapsable. When collapsed, the labels with dissappear,
				but the icons will remain there and will remain clickable. Almost all of the information on the page 
				will be dynamically rendered like the schedule\tasks sneak peaks, as well as the values in the 
				4 boxes up at the top.

				The only substantial text that will be hard coded is the FAQ section at the bottom, which will contain 
				some information about each of the fields.
			</p>

			<h3>Staff Page</h3>

			<p>
				I want most of this page to be a dynamically generated table. It will either pull data from a JS array or from a 
				databse. It will have a row for each of the employees with some information about them, as well as a way to edit
				that information. The table will also have a search field, a few filter options, and a help section at the bottom.
			</p>
			<img src="assets/images/staff_wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe of dashboard page." />

			<h3>Schedule Page</h3>
			<p>
				This page is pretty self explanatory. It gives a more detailed view of the schedule and lets you scroll through different days.
				Id like to make it so you can edit the schedules from this screen as well, but we will see how doable that is once I try.
